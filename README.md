Welcome to Brian's Advent of Code 2025. 

Goals:
- Consistent coding
- Mastery of pytonic python
- Template for other AOC coders looking to understand Python.
- Fun

Ethos:
- Try not to use AI for the AOC problems itself.
- AI can be used for template updates and other boilerplate items.
- Code should be readable and Pythonic when possible. That means using libaries when possible. 
- Perfomance comes after being right.

Happy coding!
